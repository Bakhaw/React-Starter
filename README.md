This starter is if you came from the Youtube tutorials.

If you aren't following along with the Youtube tutorial, I have a much better, and updated starter kit at https://github.com/DZuz14/react-starter-2.0. Do not use this one as it is a waste of your time.
 
1.) <code>git clone https://github.com/DZuz14/react-starter</code> <br>
2.) <code>npm install</code> <br>
3.) <code>npm start</code> <br>
4.) If you want hot reloading feature, skip #3 and type <code>npm run dev</code> instead of <code>npm start</code><br />
5.) <code>http://localhost:8080</code>
